# Model_Based_RL_Methods
Implementation of Model Based RL methods on Frozen Lake 
Implemented policy iteration and value iteration for the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI Gym and play the game with the algorithms implemented.

Guidelines to run the files and play the game:
Evaluate functions by typing "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" in terminal (you need put mdp_dp.py and mdp_dp_test.py in the same folder)
If you got error using "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" due to python version (sometimes, nosetests will use python2.7 by default), try: python3 -m nose -v mdp_dp_test.py
